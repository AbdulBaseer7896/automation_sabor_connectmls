                <div style="margin-top:6px;"><span style="font-weight:bold;">B. EXPENSES:</span> At closing, the earnest
                    money must be applied first to any cash down payment, then to Buyer's Expenses and any excess
                    refunded to Buyer. If no closing occurs, Escrow Agent may: (i) require a written release of
                    liability of the Escrow Agent from all parties before releasing any earnest money; and (ii) require
                    payment of unpaid expenses incurred on behalf of a party. Escrow Agent may deduct authorized
                    expenses from the earnest money payable to a party. “Authorized expenses” means expenses incurred by
                    Escrow Agent on behalf of the party entitled to the earnest money that were authorized by this
                    contract or that party.</div>
                <div style="margin-top:6px;"><span style="font-weight:bold;">C. DEMAND:</span> Upon termination of this
                    contract, either party or the Escrow Agent may send a release of earnest money to each party and the
                    parties shall execute counterparts of the release and deliver same to the Escrow Agent. If either
                    party fails to execute the release, either party may make a written demand to the Escrow Agent for
                    the earnest money. If only one party makes written demand for the earnest money, Escrow Agent shall
                    promptly provide a copy of the demand to the other party. If Escrow Agent does not receive written
                    objection to the demand from the other party within 15 days, Escrow Agent may disburse the earnest
                    money to the party making demand reduced by the amount of unpaid expenses incurred on behalf of the
                    party receiving the earnest money and Escrow Agent may pay the same to the creditors. If Escrow
                    Agent complies with the provisions of this paragraph, each party hereby releases Escrow Agent from
                    all adverse claims related to the disbursal of the earnest money.</div>
                <div style="margin-top:6px;"><span style="font-weight:bold;">D. DAMAGES:</span> Any party who wrongfully
                    fails or refuses to sign a release acceptable to the Escrow Agent within 7 days of receipt of the
                    request will be liable to the other party for (i) damages; (ii) the earnest money; (iii) reasonable
                    attorney's fees; and (iv) all costs of suit.</div>
                <div style="margin-top:6px;"><span style="font-weight:bold;">E. NOTICES:</span> Escrow Agent’s notices
                    will be effective when sent in compliance with Paragraph 21. Notice of objection to the demand will
                    be deemed effective upon receipt by Escrow Agent.</div>
